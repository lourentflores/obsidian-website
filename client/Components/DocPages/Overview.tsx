      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p><code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code> is a <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> server module and a GraphQL client, built to optimize application performance via caching strategies.  <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code>'s server module may be used independently to quickly build out a GraphQL API while enabling the full suite of caching strategies that <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code> offers.</p>
      <p><code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code> simplifies GraphQL implementations in Deno by offering a solution integrated across the stack, ensuring your API stays lean and performant even as it's scope grows.  By utilizing <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code> and the power of server-side rendering, we can maintain rapid page-load times.</p>
      <h2>The Module</h2>
      <p><code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code> is a Deno module, published at <a href="https://deno.land/x/obsidianv1.0.0">deno.land</a>.  There are two distinct parts to <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code>: ObsidianRouter, a caching GraphQL router built upon Deno's <a href="https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.2.0">Oak</a> server framework, and ObsidianWrapper, a <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> component that functions as a GraphQL client for your application, providing global access to fetching and caching capabilities.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that ObsidianRouter can be implemented as a standalone GraphQL router for your server, and third-party client implementations may be used in your client-side code.  Additionally, ObsidianWrapper can be used independently of ObsidianRouter if normalized caching capabilities are not needed or desired.  However, ObsidianWrapper's normalized caching strategy is only available when used in conjunction with ObsidianRouter- this choice was made to preserve the destructuring and normalizing algorithm that is at the heart of <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code>'s caching strategy.</p>
      <p>This two-pronged approach enables <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code> to guide your GraphQL implementation every step of the way, and brings clarity and speed to every part of your app.</p>
      <p className="docAside"><i>NOTE</i> - To keep our server-side cache efficient and ACID compliant, <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code> uses redis to store cached data.  If you are not utilizing the caching features of ObsidianRouter, you do not need to have a running redis server.</p>
      <h2>The Documentation</h2>
      <p>We've split our documentation into four distinct sections.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basics</strong> guides us through a simple implementation of full stack <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code>, detailing the setup of ObsidianRouter, ObsidianWrapper, usage patterns in React, and how to harness server-side rendering to improve your client caching strategy.</li>
        <li><strong>Philosophy</strong> provides a high-level overview of caching in <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code>, revealing our vision of <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code> integration and guiding principles for development.</li>
        <li><strong>Caching</strong> covers the different caching strategies <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code> offers and draws upon our Philosophy to illustrate their implementations in ObsidianRouter and ObsidianWrapper.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced</strong> contains guides for more specialized options and use-cases that we won't need while first exploring <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We hope you enjoy working with <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code>!</p>
